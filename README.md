I developed a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects, skills, and academic background. The website features a clean, responsive design with interactive elements to ensure a smooth user experience across devices. It serves as a central platform to highlight my work in web development and allows visitors to explore my technical journey, making it easier for recruiters and collaborators to connect with me.
